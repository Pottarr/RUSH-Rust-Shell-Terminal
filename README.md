# RUSH - Rust Shell Terminal

RUSH (Rust shell) is a custom terminal shell developed in The Rust Programming Language. RUSH provides users with typical features found in standard command shells (such as Bash, Zsh, etc.), including executing programs, navigating directories, file management, environment management while utilizing Rust's safety guarantees to minimize common security vulnerabilities.

RUSH (Rust Shell) project aims to develop a fast, and efficient custom shell using the Rust programming language. The RUSH terminal will provide users with different color themes to make your terminal look the way you prefer.

## About This Project

This project was developed as part of the coursework for **Elementary System Programming** in the **Software Engineering** department at **King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL)**. The aim of this project is to provide a practical application that demonstrates key programming concepts in Rust, such as system interaction, file management, and command-line interface (CLI) design.

As a part of this curriculum, RUSH is intended to give students experience in building real-world software, reinforcing essential skills in software development, problem-solving, and programming principles. RUSH not only supports beginners in learning command-line usage but also serves as a foundation for further studies in systems programming and software engineering.

## Features

-   **Beginner-Friendly**: Just type `help` in the terminal to get a list of available commands and their instructions.
-   **Command History**: RUSH automatically logs your command history, making it easy to review and reuse commands from previous sessions.

**Note**: The history log file will be created in:

-   **Windows**: `OS_drive:\Users\username\.rush\rush.log`
-   **Linux/macOS**: `~/.rush/rush.log`
